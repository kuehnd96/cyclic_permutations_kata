# Kata 1: Cyclic Permutations

         Implement the cyclic permutation method, the method should be able to output the full string of permutations
         given a set number n
        
         The results MUST NOT BE HARD CODED!
        
         Example:
         n = 5
        
         12345
         51234
         45123
         34512
         23451
        
         n = 4
        
         1234
         4123
         3412
         2341
        
         ;) Enjoy!
		 
		 
		 
# Kata 2: DivisionsAndDivisors

         Produce the divisors of a number n
        
        
         For interviewer: The goal is to test whether the interviewee can find all divisors of a number
         I guess this is more for junior developers and tests mainly if they usually like to write algorithms
         that work for specific inputs or for all inputs (yes, some of the more experience interviewers don't remember this
         although some fresh out of college devs when they can't figure it out just write an algorithm that works only for one
         input)
		 
		 

# Kata 3: Encryption Decryption

         Interviewee: Figure out what type of encryption it is, then try to make the encryption
         and decryption methods pass the tests!
        
         
         Interviewer: Ask the interviewee if he can guess what type of encryption paradigm is this!
         this is a caesar cipher. The goal is to test the person on basic pattern recognition. Also this is great
         to test how fast can someone learn as pattern recognition is strongly related to learning curve.
         The tests for this are specifically written to be extremely vague and not a very direct source for guessing what the chiper is.
         Also this is a great test for reverse engineering, which is very important when figuring out how to use library or new tech!

		
		
		
# Kata 4: FizzBuzz

         Figure out the fizz buzz paradigm
        
        
         For interviewer: This is mainly a little breather or warm up exercise, easy enough for juniors and seniors. This is mainly
         made for practicing peer programming and seen how a programmer does in a group when programming with others.
         This is easy enough and probably something someone would prepare before an interview, thus you can see if the person wants
         to do it on it's own for glory or just piggy backs!
